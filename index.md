# Bausch / Jordan lab

Our lab combines neuroscience, medicine and cutting-edge technology for the study of epilepsy and cognitive functions such as memory in the field. 
With custom neurotechnologies, including our innovative mobile ear-EEG, we investigate how the brain is shaped by internal and external landscapes,
aiming to transform these discoveries into real-world applications.

We investigate brain functions of epilepy patients and healthy subjects, both in the clinic and in daily environments, 
focusing on how internal (arousal, breathing) and external (activities, environments) contexts affect epilepsy and memory. 
Our research integrates intracranial recordings, EEGs, and tailored wearables, using neurotechnologies like mobile ear-EEGs 
to discover new neuroscience insights and apply them practically. 
We devise innovative solutions, from bare electronic components to advanced sensor systems, enabling a comprehensive view 
of brain activity from individual neurons to complex behaviors, and crafting effective interventions for clinical challenges.
