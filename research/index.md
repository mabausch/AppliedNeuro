Our lab delves into the core brain functions of memory and sleep, studying both epileptic patients and healthy subjects, in clinical environments and in daily life. We focus on examining how internal factors (such as arousal and respiration) and external factors (like daily activities and environmental contexts) influence epilepsy and cognitive processes. Our research methodology integrates data from intracranial recordings, surface EEGs, and custom-designed multimodal wearables to explore these dynamics. Utilizing cutting-edge neurotechnologies, including a versatile, mobile ear-EEG, our goal is to uncover groundbreaking insights into neuroscience and apply these findings in practical settings. Leveraging our interdisciplinary expertise spanning medicine, neuroscience, and technology, we devise innovative solutions, from microelectronic components to advanced sensor systems. This approach allows us to gain a holistic view of brain activity, from the level of individual neurons to complex behaviors, and to develop effective interventions for clinical challenges.
