I bring a wealth of experience in wearable technology development, including electronic system design, CAD, 3D printing, and a variety of rapid prototyping methods, as well as firmware and Android app development. My involvement in the MOND and AUTONOMIC clinical studies has enriched my understanding of clinical assessments for novel biomarkers and biotechnologies. Working alongside Dr. Marcel Bausch for about ten years, we have pioneered in the field of physiological signal analysis and measurement systems. An early accomplishment was our development of a device for detecting delta waves in sleep to enhance memory consolidation, based on a prototype that would evolve into today’s µEEG, capable of performing real-time analysis directly on the device.

Our collaboration has led to numerous technical projects, including innovative biomedical measurement setups and advancements in mobile EEG technology, with some achievements published as open-source hardware and software. This journey has honed my skills in rapid prototyping, significantly accelerated by recent expansions into industrial production capacities, resulting in the creation of several new prototypes.

Under the mentorship of Prof. Rainer Surges, I have gained valuable insights into clinical research and medicine. My work aims to blend my medical expertise with my technical knowledge to tackle unmet needs in seizure detection and daily epilepsy monitoring, particularly for subtle seizure types. Our efforts in developing diagnostic and monitoring solutions reflect a commitment to addressing the challenges faced by epilepsy patients in their daily lives.

As co-PI of the lab, my vision extends to leveraging our technological innovations to improve patient care and advance the field of applied neuroscience and neurotechnologies. Our team's dedication to creating impactful solutions is driven by a deep understanding of the clinical and technical realms, aiming to establish new standards in diagnostics and therapy for neurological conditions.
