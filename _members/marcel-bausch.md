As a co-leader of the Bausch / Jordan lab, my research journey began with an exploration of single neuron activity within the medial temporal lobe, especially focusing on how semantic concepts, represented by so-called 'concept neurons' in the brain, are interconnected and embedded within their context (Bausch et al., 2021, Nature Communications).  My fascination with the brain's capabilities has since evolved into exploring the broader impacts of epilepsy, leveraging both traditional intracranial measurements and cutting-edge wearable technologies to understand how different contexts affect memory and epilepsy in everyday life situations.

My current work is an extension of previous studies on epilepsy and autonomic responses (Jordan*, Bausch*, 2019, Epilepsy Research), aiming to uncover the nuances of how external environments and internal states, such as arousal and breathing, influence these complex processes. In the Bausch / Jordan lab, we're pioneering the integration of multimodal wearables with neurological research, pushing the boundaries of what's possible in real-world settings.

Bringing my expertise in experimental design, high-dimensional data analysis, and programming, I'm deeply invested in mentoring our next generation of scientists and pushing forward our collaborative projects. Together with Mr. Jordan, we're developing wearable technologies, like our innovative ear-EEG, to bring our neurological research directly into the daily lives of those we study. Our mission is to harness the intersection of neuroscience, technology, and medicine to discover groundbreaking approaches to understanding and treating epilepsy and memory disorders.
